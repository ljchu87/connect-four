# **Connect Four**
####  Gone are the days of our carefree childhood filled with nostalgia such as building giant forts made from cardboard boxes or hours spent playing our favorite board games such as Connect Four. It’s not until we become adults do we realize how much of our childhood we actually miss. As my unit 1 project, I chose to recreate Connect Four with my very own twist and flare to bring back memories I’ve locked away for years. Recreating this game reminded me so much of my childhood where all we could do was be actual kids – playing outside, riding our bikes around the neighborhood, or playing games such as Connect Four. I hope you enjoy playing this game just as much as I had fun building it!
